# Demo time!

This directory contains a couple of simple demos for RetroWrite.

## Heap

This is a simple test with both a use-after-free and an out-of-bounds
memory access. Run the test with `make heaptest`. Check
out the source and the `Makefile` for more information on how
to run the individual commands.


## Stack

This is a simple test with a stack based use-after-free and 
out-of-bounds memory access.

This is currently broken, working on it :)
